## **Disappearing Writing Text**
This code implements a simple tkinter GUI application that counts the number of words you write in a text field within a time limit of 5 seconds. If you don't write anything in the text field within the time limit, the text will disappear. The purpose of the app is to encourage users to focus on their writing and complete a specific amount of writing within a given time limit.

## **Usage**
1. Run the code from the command line using the command above.
2. A new window will open with a text field and a label displaying the time limit.
3. Type in the text field to start the timer.
4. The label will display the number of seconds remaining.
5. If you don't write anything within the time limit, the text field will be cleared and the number of words you wrote will be displayed in the label.
6. You can continue writing in the text field to start the timer again.
